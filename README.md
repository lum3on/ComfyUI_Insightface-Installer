## Installation

### Method 1: Git Clone (Recommended)

1. Navigate to your ComfyUI custom_nodes directory:
   ```bash
   cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
   ```

2. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ComfyUI-Insightface-Installer.git
   ```

3. Restart ComfyUI

### Method 2: Manual Installation

1. Download this repository as a ZIP file
2. Extract it to your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/` directory
3. Ensure the folder is named `ComfyUI-Insightface-Installer`
4. Restart ComfyUI

## Usage

1. **Add the Node**: In ComfyUI, add the "Insightface Installer" node from the `utilities/installation` category

2. **Configure Settings**:
   - **Python Version**: Select your Python version (3.10, 3.11, or 3.12)
   - **Installation Type**: Auto-detected (Portable/Regular), but can be manually overridden if needed
   - **Force Reinstall**: Enable if you want to reinstall even if Insightface is already present

3. **Execute**: Run the workflow to download and install the Insightface wheel

## Supported Wheels

The node automatically downloads the appropriate wheel from the official Gourieff Assets repository:

- **Python 3.10**: `insightface-0.7.3-cp310-cp310-win_amd64.whl`
- **Python 3.11**: `insightface-0.7.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl`
- **Python 3.12**: `insightface-0.7.3-cp312-cp312-win_amd64.whl`

## Installation Types

### Regular ComfyUI
Uses the standard pip installation method:
```bash
pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
```

### Portable ComfyUI
Uses the embedded Python installation:
```bash
python_embeded\python.exe -m pip install insightface-0.7.3-cp311-cp311-win_amd64.whl
```

## Output

The node returns a status message indicating:
- ‚úÖ Successful installation
- ‚ùå Error details if installation fails
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings for version mismatches

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Python embedded not found"**
   - The installer should auto-detect your installation type, but you can manually override if needed
   - If you have a portable installation, ensure the `python_embeded` folder exists in your ComfyUI root
   - If auto-detection fails, manually select "Regular ComfyUI" for standard installations

2. **"Download failed"**
   - Check your internet connection
   - Verify the wheel URLs are accessible
   - Try again after a few minutes

3. **"Installation failed"**
   - Check if you have write permissions to the ComfyUI directory
   - Try running ComfyUI as administrator (Windows)
   - Enable "Force Reinstall" if Insightface is already installed

### Version Mismatch Warning

If you see a warning about version mismatch, it means:
- You selected a different Python version than what's currently running
- The wheel will still be downloaded and installation attempted
- For best compatibility, select the version matching your current Python installation
